# Miracle-morning-project
This project is based on the book the "Miracle Morning" that suggests what should be done in every morning for a successful and positive day. This includes a page on: 

Meditation- links to youtube pages

Visualise- used as an image "vision board" style page

Read- with an option for the user to add a list of books they would like to read

Affrimations- the user can click on which emotion they would like to feel and affrimations will pop up that users can use.

Personally, for this project I aimed to encoperate a variety of multimedia components to practice each skill and aimed to make the website a calming and clean user experience.

Challenges:
The to do list was quite challenging but I managed to find some code from  W3 schools which I could then adapt.
I found the "responsiveness" element of website design also challenging. 

Overcame:
I experimented with using "vw" and "vh" with the @media tags to test what the capabilities. This is a key area I need to work on.

Improvements:
All the information needs to be filled in! This is simply because I felt my time was better spent on the code but will for sure need filling in before launch.

The responsiveness is not as slick as I would like on all pages- especially the read page. I want to experiment with these features further

The index page is pretty empty and could do with more styling

In the affrimations section I attempted to create a tab where users could input their own using JS. However I only managed to get to the stage where a user could input and could not get display. While I managed to insert a paragraph I could not get it to flex properly to look like the other affrimations.
